                        We are a boutique business that has been delivering effective, flexible exit interview programs
                        since 2008. Four core features at the heart of what we do:
                    </p>
                    <ol class="about-description">
                        <li>Capture meaningful, insightful exit interview results that are actionable for business. This
                            includes a collaborative design process of the exit interview and integrating neuroscience
                            techniques to increase candour from employees.<br><br></li>
                        <li>Provide an easy-to-use chart platform with flexible drill-through reporting. Leaders can
                            quickly view the top reasons for leaving by group or division, they can also receive a
                            helpful narrative of the charts with our comprehensive exit reporting.<br><br></li>
                        <li>Offer a professional, connected and engaging experience for exiting employees. We provide a
                            safe space in our phone interviews so employees can contribute their experiences. This
                            provides a sense of purpose and closure for the exiting employee, which is vitally important
                            at such a significant juncture in their life.<br><br></li>
                        <li>Provide flexible integrated programs to suit individual business need. The programs offer a
                            myriad of features that can be tailored to suit each business. For example; a license to the
                            feature-rich platform provides HR with the ability to choose face to face, online or phone
                            exit interviews. Alternatively, outsource the exit interviews solely to Workforce Retention.
                            Providing this flexibility and working with individual organisations has contributed to our
                            success. Our programs have achieved over 95% participation.<br><br></li>

                <p class="about-workforce">
                    Some years ago, I had to pull together workforce metrics to contribute to a board report. One of the
                    items to include was the 'top reasons people leave'. I was astonished to find the organisation
                    couldn’t provide helpful insight into why employees leave. Knowing the high cost of voluntary
                    turnover and impact to the business bottom line I thought, what a missed opportunity!<br><br>
                    I later learned the limitations of many internally run exit interview programs including; exit
                    interviews being run sporadically, low trust, exit interview information not collected centrally,
                    results not analysed objectively, results being filed and forgotten contributing to low engagement
                    from employees. Another common element often missed is the need for psychological safety so that
                    employees feel safe to talk. Many exit interview programs do not consider this as vitally
                    important.<br><br>
                    Seeing this powerful opportunity, I later developed an exit interview program with these features in
                    mind. Learning from the neuroscience, people can quite easily talk about a problem they’ve been
                    having, but their perspective on how things could improve is often more useful for Leaders. We
                    incorporate these kinds of techniques in the exit interviews.<br><br>
                    The insight from the data is compelling. It helps leaders understand the drivers of employee
                    turnover and the employee feels valued and heard. It also leaves the employer brand in a more
                    positive shape.<br><br>
