                <p class="about-workforce">
                    Some years ago, I had to pull together workforce metrics to contribute to a Board Report. One of the
                    items to include was the 'top reasons people leave'. I was astonished to find the organisation did
                    not have objective, helpful information about why employees leave.<br><br>

                    Knowing the high cost of voluntary turnover to business bottom line I thought, what a missed
                    opportunity!<br><br>

                    Through research I learned the limitations of many internally run exit interview programs including;
                    exit interviews being run sporadically, low trust, exit interview information not collected
                    centrally, results not analysed objectively, results being filed and forgotten.<br><br>

                    The most common limitation was that psychological safety is not considered a priority and so, many
                    missed opportunities to gather the real causes of employee turnover.<br><br>

                    In the years that followed an exit interview program was developed, tested and perfected before
                    being built onto one of the latest technology cloud platforms.<br><br>

                    Using some of the latest neuroscience research, we now incorporate techniques in the exit interviews
                    to help employees feel safe and heard. Once we have that it's about guiding the exiting employee out
                    of the detail, problem and drama and into the planning, solution and visioning part of the brain
                    where we can understand and record insightful suggestions and improvements for the
                    organisation.<br><br>

                    The insight from the data is compelling. It helps businesses understand the drivers of employee
                    turnover and leaves employees feeling they've been heard and valued. It also leaves the employer
                    brand in a more positive shape.<br><br>

                    The flexible platform allows organisations to either run internal face to face interviews,
                    administer an online exit interview or outsource the entire service to us where we have a talented
                    team of women who expertly administer and conduct phone exit interviews.<br><br>

                    Our programs have achieved over 95% participation.<br><br>
